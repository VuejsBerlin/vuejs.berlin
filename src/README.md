## Meetups & Talks

Our meetups take place monthly every second Tuesday at 7pm. We usually have at least one talk right after we ate some pizza and had some drinks. We also [stream](https://www.instagram.com/vuejs_berlin/) and [record](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSmiKom-8XsWbi5NTWurjg) the talks from time to time. Records are usually available one or two days after the meetup. Unfortunately there are no recordings since a few months due to a technical issue. We're working on it.

Find all meetup recordings [here](/meetups/) or on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSmiKom-8XsWbi5NTWurjg)

## Newsletters

Shortly after every meetup we publish newsletters to help you keeping up with all the events in and around the community.

You can find them in our [newsletter section](/newsletters/)
