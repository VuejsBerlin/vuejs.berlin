## Meetups & Talks

Out meetups take place monthly every second Tuesday at 7pm. We usually have at least one talk right after we ate some pizza and had some drinks. We also [stream](https://www.instagram.com/vuejs_berlin/) and [record](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSmiKom-8XsWbi5NTWurjg) the talks every time. Records are usually available one or two days after the meetup.
