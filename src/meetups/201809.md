## 2018-09-11 // Design Systems

Design Systems are super hype now. Atlassian, Sketch, Google are using it, even GOV.UK has their own design system. Most people think the design system is only important to designers, but there are so many similarities between the project structure and design system.

Jun Yu from [3YOURMIND](https://www.3yourmind.com/) created their design system called "Kotti". The creator and designer would like to share their experience and method during the design and development.
