## 2018-12-11 // Game Programming with Vuejs

We'll have a short lightning talk by Petr  about static types vs dynamic types. It will be fun, promised!

And because not everyone was able to attend the Vuejs Roadtrip main event, Norman will once again have his talk about his game development journey with Vuejs!
