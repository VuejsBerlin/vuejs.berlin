Dear Vue'sers,

welcome to the third Vuejs Berlin newsletter. 

Numbers
-------

Our community got its 970th member today! So we grew even more last month then the month before (+56 vs +46). I think this is pretty awesome and if the trend holds we can greet the 1000th member pretty soon! (Now imagine  me doing a happy dance).

Announcements
-------------

The next Vuejs // Berlin meetup will be on 11th of September and we already have a talk to announce for that date: Junyu Pu from 3YourMind will talk about the Kotti Design System. Read more about it on [the website](https://3yourmind.github.io/kotti/) and check out [Junyus Github](https://github.com/ostoc).

Because some people only come for the food: Yes, there will be pizza again, thanks to our awesome sponsor [FromAtoB](https://fromatob.de).

What you might have missed
--------------------------

This months meetup hosted the awesome Darek WÄ™drychowski a.k.a. Gusto from VueLand. He intially planned to have an in-depth talk about his current project called [Formics](https://github.com/gustojs/formics), a form generator for Vuejs. Unfortunately because of a series of events he lost the prepared presentation and had to improvise a lot. We still learned a lot from his presentation though and I'm looking forward to the intended version of the talk when he will have in Kyiv soon.

For the first time we had a live stream via Instagram with guests from as far as Argentinia. I hope we can build on this to engage more people from all over the world!

As always you'll find the recording on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSmiKom-8XsWbi5NTWurjg/videos) as s oon as they are ready.

And that's it for this month! Check out the [web version](https://vuejs.berlin/newsletter/201808.html) of this newsletter to get updates and typo fixes!
