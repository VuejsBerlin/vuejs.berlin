Dear Vue'sers,

welcome to the sixth Vuejs // Berlin newsletter. Your best stop for way to late newsletters is here!

Announcements
-------------

**tl;dr: The December meetup will be about gaming**

On the Vuejs Roadtrip event in Berlin Norman had a talk about his game programming journey with Vuejs. For everyone who couldn't attend the event we have good news: He will have his talk once more in our December meetup!


What you might have missed
--------------------------

In collaboration with the Team from Vuejs Roadtrip we brought the Vuejs Berlin and Vuejs Roadtrip meetup together on the day before the main event.

Around 60 people participated and enjoyed 6 talks. Thats one talk per 10 people. Sounds exclusive, doesn't it?

After a short introduction from James (organizer of the Roadtrip and Vuejs Amsterdam), Jiri talked about how FromAtoB found its way to Vuejs (hint: it was quite some convincing necessary). Lucas, another Senior Engineer at FromAtoB then talked about Engineering Culture but without the bullshit. It was a pleasure to also have Guillaume Chau of the Vuejs Core Team. He talked about the fantastic Vue CLI. After him, Sumit Kumar from Car2Go told us a bit more about the many uses of Vuejs at Car2Go. Last but not least Kiril Bunin, the Vuejs Prague Community Leader, talked about Event handling in Vuejs.

What an evening!

The following day was the main Vuejs Roadtrip event. You can read more about it in [their medium article](https://medium.com/@Vuejsamsterdam/vuejs-roadtrip-berlin-e724c43d56c9)
and on [entwickler.de](https://entwickler.de/online/javascript/vue-js-graphql-579868890.html) (in german).
