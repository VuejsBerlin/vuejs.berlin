Dear Vue'sers,

welcome to the second monthly Vuejs Berlin newsletter, or 2ndMVBN for short! Just kidding, no abbreviations here. We better use the `VuejsBerlinNewsletterInterfaceGenerator` class and version it!

Numbers
-------

Since the last newsletter, 46 new members registered. With *914 members* we're closing up to Vuejs New York, which grew by "only" 32 members in the same time. Whoop whoop!

But more importantly: Congratulations VuejsNYC for crossing the 1000 members mark! Awesome achievement!

Announcements
-------------

After the meetup is before the meetup! Our next meetup will be on 14th of August! Save the date. Get some pizza, beer and maybe a talk about some digging game made with Vuejs.

We decided that we need a bit more structure for meetups with more than one talk. Things will take too long otherwise and the last presenter will have a hard time to keep peoples attention. More to that will be announced on the meetup page.

What you might have missed
--------------------------

We had two interesting talks yesterday.

Johannes Werner from BCG Digital Ventures talked about his absolutely fabulous [vue-starter](https://vue-starter.herokuapp.com/). Check out the website and docs to learn more about this opinionated boilerplate that contains just about everything you'll ever need for a jump start.

Afterwards Sultan Iman talked about REST patterns, explaining thoroughly the different approaches to structure the API call side of your application. The [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/imanhodjaev/vue-and-rest-api-patterns) and a [blog version](https://medium.com/@imanhodjaev/handling-api-calls-in-vue-cf39747656ba) of the talk are available online. Definitely worth a look!

You can find the recordings in our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSmiKom-8XsWbi5NTWurjg/videos) as soon as they are ready!

What to do until next meetup
----------------------------

Impatient people can check out some of the following links to keep up to date until the next meetup:

`vue-cli` reached release candidate status and got its own [docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/)! I didn't find time yet to check it out but I definitely will. Maybe someone wants to talk about it at one of the upcoming meetups?

If documentation is to direct, try StÃ©phane PÃ©ricats [excellent article](https://morningstar.engineering/vue-ui-a-first-look-916600d9a918) about Vue UI to get your mouth wettenend.

If you're completely new to Vuejs, I can recommend [CSS-Tricks Guide to Vuejs](https://css-tricks.com/guides/vue/). It is a five part series introducing the framework, giving a very good overview and also quite some detail on what you can do and how.

Jobs
----

I thought it might make sense to put a jobs section here, at least until we have a good job board on vuejs.berlin (development here is still stalling ðŸ˜¢).

### FromAtoB

Our main sponsor (thanks a lot for all the pizza!) is looking for a  Frontend developer. They are using Vuejs (and some legacy rails templates), and working there would be your perfect opportunity to never miss a meetup again!

If you're interested, head out to [Jiri](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Vue-js-Berlin/members/90619832/).

### Wunderdog

[Wunderdog](https://wunder.dog) is an awesome place to work for people who value a fabulous culture and lots of freedom, but know that this comes with responsibility. Learn more here: https://wunder.dog/fullstack-developer-berlin-germany
