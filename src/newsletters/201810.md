title: Newsletter 2018-10
---
Dear Vue'sers,

welcome to the fifth Vuejs // Berlin newsletter. I'm writing this newsletter without actually having been at the last meetup which is why the `what you might have missed` section got a more fitting name.

Announcements
-------------

**tl;dr: The November meetup will be Thursday, November 22nd!**

November will be a very special month for us: The Vuejs Roadtrip is coming to Berlin!

The main event will happen at the community space of [Blacklane](https://www.blacklane.com/en/about) on November 23rd. One day before the event, we will have our meetup joined together with the Roadtrip meetup at the usual place in the FromAtoB office.

Don't miss out on this. There will not only be core members and high profile talks but also the chance to **win tickets to the main event**!

And there are also some news for December already! December 4th and 5th will be the [Frontend Con 2018](https://frontend-con.io/) in Warsaw. Vuejs // Berlin is community partner of this conference and thanks to that we can offer 10% discount to the conference tickets for our community. Additionally for every fifth ticket that is purchased with our community code we get a free ticket. So check out their speakers and if you want a discount, write us!

What I definitely have missed :sob:
-----------------------------------

As you might noticed, I missed the last meetup which first of all broke my intent to keep this Newsletter neutral (as in no "I") and of course made me super sad. I missed Peter Leonovs talk about Introscope (but I watched the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA_EWjHYuqA)). I missed the popcorn machine :popcorn: and I felt the need to use emojis for the very first time in this newsletter :tada::100::rofl:


What to do until next meetup
----------------------------

If you have a blog or any other publishing you might consider trying Vuepress. [vuejs.berlin](https://vuejs.berlin) is made with it, too. I'm mentioning it because version 1.0 is now in alpha stage and it brings some super interesting new features like plugin support!

Now that plugins a topic, you might have noticed that Vue-CLI version 3 also has plugin support. If you wonder what that means: For example you can add [SSR](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html) to your existing Vue application with just one line (or a few clicks in the UI)! See [Akryums SSR plugin](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-cli-plugin-ssr) for more information. Now if you want to get a step further, maybe [write your own plugin](https://dev.to/vuevixens/how-to-build-a-vue-cli-plugin-3b6b)

If you're completely new to Vuejs, I can as always recommend the [CSS-Tricks Guide to Vuejs](https://css-tricks.com/guides/vue/). It is a five part series introducing the framework, giving a very good overview and also quite some detail on what you can do and how. And I'm not getting paid for putting this paragraph in here all the time.
