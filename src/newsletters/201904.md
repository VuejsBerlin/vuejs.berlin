title: April 2019
---
Dear Vue'sers,

welcome to seventh Vuejs // Berlin newsletter. This one should be titled "delay is just a word".

Announcements
-------------

**tl;dr: We're terribly sorry AND location change for the next meetup**

The meetup flourished in 2019 and there was not a single event without at least one speaker, yet we didn't have any newsletters or recordings since January.

We want to apologize for this. Sure, lots of excuses could be piled up here but that is not the point. We'll try to get back on track and this newsletter is the start. Unfortunately no recordings happened on the April meetup though.

There's one actual announcement to make still: The May meetup will not be at the FromAtoB offices at usual. Instead you'll find us at the [3YOURMIND](https://www.3yourmind.com/contact) office space. This is a one time special event, so everything will be back to normal in June. More information will be coming soon on the [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Vue-js-Berlin/events/). 

What you might have missed
--------------------------

In case you missed the last meetup you unfortunately also missed [Damian](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz), Vuejs Core Team member, curator of [Vue.js News](https://news.vuejs.org/), author of [Vue Multiselect](https://vue-multiselect.js.org/) and generelly an awesome person. He talked about Composing Components in Vuejs and showed us different ways of composition and how and when they make sense.

Our second talk was by Mike Solomon, the founder of [Meeshkan](https://www.meeshkan.com/), a Helsinki based DevOps company, who is also the artistic director of [Ensemble 101](http://www.ensemble101.fr/). He talked about Testing Apps with third-party API integrations and told us about different strategies and best practices to test API integrations in node apps.

The third awesome thing you might have missed is our little spontaneous conference ticket raffle: [iJS](https://javascript-conference.com/), the international JavaScript conference in London sponsored a free ticket and a 15% dicount voucher for the whole community. To get the discount, use the voucher `vue-ijs-15-berlin` at [the ticket shop](https://javascript-conference.com/tickets).
